      "- 1/2 grapefruit, peeled and if possible, peeled to remove white pith\n",
      "- 1 orange, peeled\n",
      "- 1/2 lemon, peeled\n",
      "- 1/2 inch fresh ginger, peeled\n",
      "- 1/2 inch fresh turmeric root, peeled (or 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric)\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon honey (adjust to taste; you can use maple syrup for a vegan option)\n",
      "- 1/2 cup plain yogurt (d dairy) or 1/2 cup dairy-free yogurt (or use 1/4 cup yogurt + 1/4 cup almond milk if you want a lighter texture)\n",
      "- 1/2 cup ice (or 1/4 cup ice + 1/4 cup water/juice)\n",
      "- Optional: pinch black pepper (helps with turmeric absorption)\n",
      "- Optional: a few fresh mint leaves for garnish\n",

      "Instructions\n",
      "1) Prep the produce: Peel and section the grapefruit and orange. Remove seeds if any. Peel the lemon. Grate or finely chop the ginger; slice the turmeric if using fresh.\n",
      "2) Add to blender in the following order: grapefruit, orange, lemon, ginger, turmeric, yogurt, honey, ice.\n",
      "3) Blend on high until smooth and creamy. If the mixture is too thick, add a splash of water or extra juice; if too tart, add a touch more honey.\n",
      "4) Taste and adjust sweetness or citrus balance. Pour into a glass and garnish with a mint leaf or a thin citrus twist if you like.\n",
      "5) Serve immediately for best flavor and nutrition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips and variations\n",
      "- Dairy-free option: Use dairy-free yogurt and/or swap in 1/4 cup dairy-free yogurt plus 1/4 cup orange juice or almond milk for a lighter texture.\n",
      "- Boost fiber or greens: Add a handful of spinach or kale (you may want to balance sweetness with a touch more honey).\n",
      "- Extra kick: Add another 1/4 inch of ginger or a dash of black pepper.\n",
      "- Make it into a batch: Multiply ingredients by 2–4 for a multi-serving smoothie; blend in batches if your blender isn’t large enough.\n",
